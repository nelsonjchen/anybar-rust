# Anybar Rust

Small Rust app to send commands to [Anybar](https://github.com/tonsky/AnyBar).

Just a dumb stupid test of the networking in the I/O library.

There's some vague library thing but it's not much.

## TODO

* Can a UDP Socket be made without a bind so UDP Packets can be sent without
  binding?
